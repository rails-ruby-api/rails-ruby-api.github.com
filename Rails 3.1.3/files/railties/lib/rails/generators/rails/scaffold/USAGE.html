<p>Description:</p>

<pre>Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
views, along with a full test suite. The resource is ready to use as a
starting point for your RESTful, resource-oriented application.

Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
pairs.

Attribute pairs are field:type arguments specifying the
model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

For example, 'scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean'
gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
an index that lists them all, as well as a resources :posts
declaration in config/routes.rb.

If you want to remove all the generated files, run
'rails destroy scaffold ModelName'.</pre>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>`rails generate scaffold post`
`rails generate scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean`
`rails generate scaffold purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal`</pre>
