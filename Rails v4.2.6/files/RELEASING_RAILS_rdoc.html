<h1 id="label-Releasing+Rails">Releasing Rails</h1>

<p>In this document, we&#39;ll cover the steps necessary to release Rails. 
Each section contains steps to take during that time before the release. 
The times suggested in each header are just that: suggestions.  However,
they should really be considered as minimums.</p>

<h2 id="label-10+Days+before+release">10 Days before release</h2>

<p>Today is mostly coordination tasks.  Here are the things you must do today:</p>

<h3 id="label-Is+the+CI+green-3F++If+not-2C+make+it+green.+-28See+-22Fixing+the+CI-22-29">Is the CI green?  If not, make it green. (See “Fixing the CI”)</h3>

<p>Do not release with a Red CI.  You can find the CI status here:</p>

<pre><code>http://travis-ci.org/rails/rails
</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Is+Sam+Ruby+happy-3F++If+not-2C+make+him+happy.">Is Sam Ruby happy?  If not, make him happy.</h3>

<p>Sam Ruby keeps a test suite that makes sure the code samples in his book
(Agile <a href="../classes/Web.html">Web</a> Development with Rails) all
work.  These are valuable integration tests for Rails.  You can check the
status of his tests here:</p>

<pre><code>http://intertwingly.net/projects/dashboard.html
</code></pre>

<p>Do not release with Red AWDwR tests.</p>

<h3 id="label-Are+the+supported+plugins+working-3F+If+not-2C+make+it+work.">Are the supported plugins working? If not, make it work.</h3>

<p>Some Rails plugins are important and need to be supported until Rails 5. As
these plugins are outside the Rails repository it is easy to break them
without knowing after some refactoring or bug fix, so it is important to
check if the following plugins are working with the versions that will be
released:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/rails/protected_attributes">github.com/rails/protected_attributes</a></p>
</li><li>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/rails/activerecord-deprecated_finders">github.com/rails/activerecord-deprecated_finders</a></p>
</li></ul>

<p>Do not release red plugins tests.</p>

<h3 id="label-Do+we+have+any+Git+dependencies-3F++If+so-2C+contact+those+authors.">Do we have any Git dependencies?  If so, contact those authors.</h3>

<p>Having Git dependencies indicates that we depend on unreleased code.
Obviously Rails cannot be released when it depends on unreleased code. <a
href="../classes/Contact.html">Contact</a> the authors of those particular
gems and work out a release date that suits them.</p>

<h3 id="label-Contact+the+security+team+-28either+Koz+or+tenderlove-29"><a href="../classes/Contact.html">Contact</a> the security team (either Koz or tenderlove)</h3>

<p>Let them know of your plans to release.  There may be security issues to be
addressed, and that can impact your release date.</p>

<h3 id="label-Notify+implementors.">Notify implementors.</h3>

<p>Ruby implementors have high stakes in making sure Rails works.  Be kind and
give them a heads up that Rails will be released soonish.</p>

<p>This only need to be done for major and minor releases, bugfix releases
aren&#39;t a big enough deal, and are supposed to be backwards compatible.</p>

<p>Send an email just giving a heads up about the upcoming release to these
lists:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>team@jruby.org</p>
</li><li>
<p>community@rubini.us</p>
</li><li>
<p>rubyonrails-core@googlegroups.com</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Implementors will love you and help you.</p>

<h2 id="label-3+Days+before+release">3 Days before release</h2>

<p>This is when you should release the release candidate.  Here are your tasks
for today:</p>

<h3 id="label-Is+the+CI+green-3F++If+not-2C+make+it+green.">Is the CI green?  If not, make it green.</h3>

<h3 id="label-Is+Sam+Ruby+happy-3F++If+not-2C+make+him+happy.">Is Sam Ruby happy?  If not, make him happy.</h3>

<h3 id="label-Contact+the+security+team.++CVE+emails+must+be+sent+on+this+day."><a href="../classes/Contact.html">Contact</a> the security team.  CVE emails must be sent on this day.</h3>

<h3 id="label-Create+a+release+branch.">Create a release branch.</h3>

<p>From the stable branch, create a release branch.  For example, if
you&#39;re releasing Rails 3.0.10, do this:</p>

<pre><code>[aaron@higgins rails (3-0-stable)]$ git checkout -b 3-0-10
Switched to a new branch &#39;3-0-10&#39;
[aaron@higgins rails (3-0-10)]$</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Update+each+CHANGELOG.">Update each <a href="actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a>.</h3>

<p>Many times commits are made without the <a
href="actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a> being updated.  You
should review the commits since the last release, and fill in any missing
information for each <a
href="actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a>.</p>

<p>You can review the commits for the 3.0.10 release like this:</p>

<pre><code>[aaron@higgins rails (3-0-10)]$ git log v3.0.9..</code></pre>

<p>If you&#39;re doing a stable branch release, you should also ensure that
all of the <a href="actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a> entries
in the stable branch are also synced to the master branch.</p>

<h3 id="label-Update+the+RAILS_VERSION+file+to+include+the+RC.">Update the <a href="RAILS_VERSION.html">RAILS_VERSION</a> file to include the RC.</h3>

<h3 id="label-Build+and+test+the+gem."><a href="../classes/Build.html">Build</a> and test the gem.</h3>

<p>Run `rake install` to generate the gems and install them locally. Then try
generating a new app and ensure that nothing explodes.</p>

<p>This will stop you from looking silly when you push an RC to rubygems.org
and then realise it is broken.</p>

<h3 id="label-Release+the+gem.">Release the gem.</h3>

<p>IMPORTANT: Due to YAML parse problems on the rubygems.org server, it is
safest to use Ruby 1.8 when releasing.</p>

<p>Run `rake release`.  This will populate the gemspecs with data from <a
href="RAILS_VERSION.html">RAILS_VERSION</a>, commit the changes, tag it,
and push the gems to rubygems.org. Here are the commands that `rake
release` should use, so you can understand what to do in case anything goes
wrong:</p>

<pre><code>$ rake all:build
$ git commit -am&#39;updating RAILS_VERSION&#39;
$ git tag -m &#39;v3.0.10.rc1 release&#39; v3.0.10.rc1
$ git push
$ git push --tags
$ for i in $(ls pkg); do gem push $i; done</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Send+Rails+release+announcements">Send Rails release announcements</h3>

<p>Write a release announcement that includes the version, changes, and links
to GitHub where people can find the specific commit list.  Here are the
mailing lists where you should announce:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>rubyonrails-core@googlegroups.com</p>
</li><li>
<p>rubyonrails-talk@googlegroups.com</p>
</li><li>
<p>ruby-talk@ruby-lang.org</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Use Markdown format for your announcement.  Remember to ask people to
report issues with the release candidate to the rails-core mailing list.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: If any users experience regressions when using the release
candidate, you <strong>must</strong> postpone the release.  Bugfix releases
*should not* break existing applications.</p>

<h3 id="label-Post+the+announcement+to+the+Rails+blog."><a href="../classes/Post.html">Post</a> the announcement to the Rails blog.</h3>

<p>If you used Markdown format for your email, you can just paste it in to the
blog.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org">weblog.rubyonrails.org</a></p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Post+the+announcement+to+the+Rails+Twitter+account."><a href="../classes/Post.html">Post</a> the announcement to the Rails Twitter account.</h3>

<h2 id="label-Time+between+release+candidate+and+actual+release"><a href="../classes/Time.html">Time</a> between release candidate and actual release</h2>

<p>Check the rails-core mailing list and the GitHub issue list for regressions
in the RC.</p>

<p>If any regressions are found, fix the regressions and repeat the release
candidate process.  We will not release the final until 72 hours after the
last release candidate has been pushed.  This means that if users find
regressions, the scheduled release date must be postponed.</p>

<p>When you fix the regressions, do not create a new branch.  Fix them on the
stable branch, then cherry pick the commit to your release branch.  No
other commits should be added to the release branch besides regression
fixing commits.</p>

<h2 id="label-Day+of+release">Day of release</h2>

<p>Many of these steps are the same as for the release candidate, so if you
need more explanation on a particular step, see the RC steps.</p>

<p>Today, do this stuff in this order:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Apply security patches to the release branch</p>
</li><li>
<p>Update <a href="actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a> with security
fixes.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Update <a href="RAILS_VERSION.html">RAILS_VERSION</a> to remove the rc</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="../classes/Build.html">Build</a> and test the gem</p>
</li><li>
<p>Release the gems</p>
</li><li>
<p>If releasing a new stable version:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Trigger stable docs generation (see below)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Update the version in the home page</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Email security lists</p>
</li><li>
<p>Email general announcement lists</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Emailing+the+Rails+security+announce+list">Emailing the Rails security announce list</h3>

<p>Email the security announce list once for each vulnerability fixed.</p>

<p>You can do this, or ask the security team to do it.</p>

<p>Email the security reports to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>rubyonrails-security@googlegroups.com</p>
</li><li>
<p>oss-security@lists.openwall.com</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Be sure to note the security fixes in your announcement along with CVE
numbers and links to each patch.  Some people may not be able to upgrade
right away, so we need to give them the security fixes in patch form.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><a href="../classes/Blog.html">Blog</a> announcements</p>
</li><li>
<p>Twitter announcements</p>
</li><li>
<p>Merge the release branch to the stable branch.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Drink beer (or other cocktail)</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Misc">Misc</h2>

<h3 id="label-Fixing+the+CI">Fixing the CI</h3>

<p>There are two simple steps for fixing the CI:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Identify the problem</p>
</li><li>
<p>Fix it</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Repeat these steps until the CI is green.</p>
