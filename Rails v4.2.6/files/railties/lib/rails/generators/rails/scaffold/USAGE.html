<p>Description:</p>

<pre><code>Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
views, along with a full test suite. The resource is ready to use as a
starting point for your RESTful, resource-oriented application.

Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
pairs.

Attributes are field arguments specifying the model&#39;s attributes. You can
optionally pass the type and an index to each field. For instance:
&#39;title body:text tracking_id:integer:uniq&#39; will generate a title field of
string type, a body with text type and a tracking_id as an integer with an
unique index. &quot;index&quot; could also be given instead of &quot;uniq&quot; if one desires
a non unique index.

As a special case, specifying &#39;password:digest&#39; will generate a
password_digest field of string type, and configure your generated model,
controller, views, and test suite for use with ActiveModel
has_secure_password (assuming they are using Rails defaults).

Timestamps are added by default, so you don&#39;t have to specify them by hand
as &#39;created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime&#39;.

You don&#39;t have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

For example, &#39;scaffold post title body:text published:boolean&#39; gives
you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
an index that lists them all, as well as a resources :posts declaration
in config/routes.rb.

If you want to remove all the generated files, run
&#39;rails destroy scaffold ModelName&#39;.</code></pre>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>`rails generate scaffold post`
`rails generate scaffold post title body:text published:boolean`
`rails generate scaffold purchase amount:decimal tracking_id:integer:uniq`
`rails generate scaffold user email:uniq password:digest`
</code></pre>
